# Kashall's VyOS Config

> This repo is used in conjunction with my [home-cluster](https://github.com/kashalls/home-cluster).

## Getting Started

I am currently running a custom rolling release build from [onedr0p/vyos-build](https://github.com/onedr0p/vyos-build/releases). It adds a couple extra packages to make things simpler.

Pretty much it consists of downloading the image, booting to it on your least favorite but reliable usb. Logging in with `vyos` as username and password. You then follow this guide: https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/installation/install.html#permanent-installation
